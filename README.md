# DataFestAfrica2023

## Project Brief

### Background
AgResources Inc. is poised for expansion and strategic investment in its farms. The vast data collated over the years serves as a treasure trove to carve out the company's future direction. But decisions must be precise, deliberate, and data-driven.

### Objective
To extract in-depth insights and recommendations that will shape the company's strategic plans for the coming years.

### Outcome
We analyzed AgResources Inc.'s farming data, specifically focusing on crop yields and environmental factors. While crop yields were found to be consistent across types, various environmental factors, such as weather conditions, source of irrigation, and pest severity, played significant roles in influencing these yields.

To ensure sustained profitability, it's essential to consider production costs, market demand, and the selling price of crops. Environmental factors, including changing weather patterns and water scarcity due to climate change, are major risks. Pests present another set of challenges, with the potential for increased severity, emergence of new pests, and pesticide resistance.

Economic challenges encompass market fluctuations and increased operational costs. The soil's health is paramount for continued crop yields, making soil degradation a concern. As farming relies heavily on labor, potential labor shortages present another risk. Finally, changing agricultural policies and shifting consumer perceptions towards sustainability and organic farming could affect farming operations.

In conclusion, while AgResources Inc. has consistent yields, a proactive approach to addressing environmental, economic, resource-related, and regulatory challenges is crucial for ensuring long-term profitability and sustainability.
